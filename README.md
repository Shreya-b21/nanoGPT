About This Project
This repository contains my personal implementation of Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT, a minimalistic and clean PyTorch re-implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) training. This project aims to provide a clear, concise, and runnable version of GPT, focusing on understanding the core mechanics of transformer architectures and large language model training.

My goal with this implementation was to:

Deepen my understanding of the GPT architecture from scratch.

Experiment with training on custom datasets.

Optimize for readability and simplicity while maintaining core functionality.

Features
Minimalistic GPT-2 Architecture: A clean PyTorch implementation of the GPT-2 model.

Customizable Training: Easily adapt the code to train on your own text datasets.

Text Generation: Generate new text samples after training.

Configurable Model Size: Adjust model parameters (e.g., number of layers, heads, embedding dimensions) to suit your needs and computational resources.

(Add specific features if you implemented any unique ones, e.g., "Supports mixed-precision training", "Integrated with Weights & Biases for logging")

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

Access to a GPU (highly recommended for training, especially in Google Colab)

Installation
Clone this repository (or download the .ipynb file if you uploaded that):

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_NANO_GPT_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_NANO_GPT_REPO_NAME

(If you uploaded the .ipynb directly, you'll just need to open it in Google Colab.)

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt # If you create a requirements.txt
# OR
pip install torch transformers datasets tokenizers tqdm # List specific libraries

(In Google Colab, you might use !pip install ... directly in a cell.)

Running the Code
(Adjust these instructions based on how your code is structured. If it's a single .ipynb file, explain how to run cells.)

To train the model:

python train.py --config_file=config/default.py # Example if you have config files
# OR
python your_main_script.py --dataset=tinyshakespeare --epochs=10

To generate text:

python generate.py --model_path=output/model_checkpoint.pt --prompt="Once upon a time"

(If your code is entirely in a Colab notebook, explain which cells to run in order, e.g., "Run cells 1-5 for data preparation, then cell 6 for training, and cell 7 for inference.")

Dataset
This implementation was primarily tested with the tinyshakespeare dataset, a small dataset suitable for quick experimentation.

To use tinyshakespeare: The data preparation script will automatically download and preprocess it.

To use a custom dataset:

Place your raw text file (e.g., my_custom_data.txt) in the data/ directory.

Modify the data loading part of the script (e.g., data/prepare.py or directly in your notebook) to point to your new file.

Ensure your dataset is sufficiently large and clean for training.

Usage Examples
(Show snippets of generated text here! This is very impactful.)

After training on tinyshakespeare for X epochs, here's an example of generated text with the prompt "To be or not to be":

To be or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
